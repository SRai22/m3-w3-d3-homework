## Project Description
This project is a simple web page that showcases a recipe website called "Simple Kitchen". It uses SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) to style the components, leveraging features such as variables, mixins, nesting, and importing partials to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. The page includes a navigation bar, an introductory text section, and an image section, all styled with modern CSS techniques.

## Usage
